            Pano ko ba to sisimulan? HAHAH...So ayun gusto ko gawin sayo tong letter been wanting to say this 
to you pero ayun. just wanna say keep going lang i know you have been through much especially may
times na napapagod ka na sa buhay both at home and school i'm not aware on everything pero i really
admire you for still moving forward despite lahat ng sakit and mga unfair things towards sayo. and yes
life is very unfair hindi lahat ng gusto natin and expectations ay makakamit, but i believe you're
strong and you always do your best on everything so be proud of yourself and keep moving forward 
no matter the case. 
        </p>

If you think inde para sayo ang love i think your wrong on that cuz you do. i don't know everything about
you, but i am sure na mapagmahal and genuine ka it's just inde ka na trato ng tama which you never deserve. 
don't question kung san ka nagkulang you did your best and everything in return you recieved unfairness
and pain. it's okay to cry it doesn't give a sign of weakness but it shows you've been strong a long time, 
release all the pain, stress, unwanted feelings. let time help you and let Jesus guide you. always have 
faith sa sarili mo. remember i'll be here for you and please know....I Love You.
